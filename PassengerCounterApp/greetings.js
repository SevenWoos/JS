// Create two variables, name and greeting. The name variable should store your name,
// and the greeting should store e.g. "Hi, my name is "

// Create a third variable, myGreeting, that contatenates the two strings
// Log myGreeting to the console

let name = "Sven"
let greeting = "Hi, my name is " 

let myGreeting = greeting + name

console.log(myGreeting)

// 42 gets turned into a string automatically
let name2 = 42

let myGreeting2 = greeting + name2

console.log(myGreeting2)


// Strings always wins
let points = 4
let bonusPoints = "10"

let totalPoints = points + bonusPoints
console.log(totalPoints)

// More practice
console.log(4 + 5)
console.log("2" + "4")
console.log("5" + 1)
console.log(100 + "100")
